## Summary

The Ensemble Classifiers, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, were better at predicting high credit risk. 
The BalancedRandomForestClassifier had 4% precision and the EasyEnsembleClassifier had 7% precision when predicting high risk, compared to the 1% precision of the Resampling models: Naive Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, CLusterCentroid Undersampling, SMOTEENN Over Under Sampling.

When dealing with credit card risk being able to predict high credit risk is important. Therefore, I would choose none of these options to predict credit risk.
